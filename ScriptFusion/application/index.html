<h2><p>
This is the new, improved help file. While originally it was an interesting concept to create the help file as a script, executable through the application, the limitations of a basic text file could not provide the resources necessary to provide enough user support.
</p><p>
This application began as a text file, branched from the original configuration script for the imoseyon sense kernel, with added features for a customizable voltage / frequency option and a backup / restore option. The tweak package, including swap and other system tweaks, was later integrated and modified. Since that time, many new options, tweaks, and modifications have been added. The purpose was one text file to replace ten applications. The same theory still applies with one application.
</p><p>
The first time this application is run, it will verify that the script is installed. If so, nothing will be done to the existing file. If the script is not present, a modified version is installed that will use binaries included within the application. This allows the script to run on the most incompatible systems. This has been tested by using a Droid. While the script did install through the native method on the Droid, it required installing busybox manually, and displayed multiple errors throughout use. With the application performing the install, no issues were encountered and the script ran effectively.
</p><p>
The script itself can still be run using a favored terminal application. GUI versions of most functions of the script are in development and will serve as an alternate method, but will not replace installing the script as a feature.
<p></p>
For those without a Terminal app installed, or do not want to switch applications, the console option is a direct link to a built-in terminal. When pressed, the script will launch itself. This terminal will allow direct use of the speedtweak script.
</p><p>
If ext2buntu has been installed, a console is also available. It will launch the main service menu, with editing and launch options for a current installation.
</p><p> 
The application offers a new feature that allows the use of functions. These functions can be run individually, or in sequence. The scripts option also has menu buttons allowing the install of both the speedtweak script and ext2buntu.
</p><p>
In trial mode, this about screen offers the menu option for licensing to provide all available methods of obtaining a full copy of ScriptFusion AutoBot.

In the scripts option, clicking an icon and selecting "LinkUp", will be add the chosen script to the sequence. When the user is ready to perform the sequence, choosing execute on the last option to be added will run the entire sequence. Reboot will always be performed last, and selection order does not affect running sequence.
</p><p>
The icons for each script give a summary of function. For example, reboot would be reboot, zipalign will perform the zipalign process on all apk files, and busybox will install busybox and symlink the applets in the /system/xbin folder. An explanation of each script is available by clicking on the script and choosing "Explain"
